\subsection{Basic History}
    In 1959, Moore, Edward F. presented one of the first shortest path through a maze algorithm
    \cite{MooreRef}, after a couple of years in 1961 Lee, C. Y. presented the idea of simulating the 
    board wiring on electronics board as a Maze \cite{LeeRef}. Starting from there the idea of Lee Maze
    has been revisited many times, in 1983 Hightower, D. made more contribution to the idea such that
    using modern computers and virtual memories we can memic the routing problem precisely providing 
    different techniques \cite{HightowerRef}.
