\begin{itemize}
	\item Maze : A $[D,W,H]$ matrix that contains cells, used to simulate the grid.
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item D : Number of layers.
	    \item W : Width of the layer.
	    \item H : Height of the layer.
	\end{itemize}
    \item Cells : Each cell is a pin, a cell could represent a pin or an obstacle.
	\item Pin : The part where transistors gets connected to.
	\item Source : The starting point \emph{(pin)} that needs to be connected to some targets.
	\item Targets : One or more point/s \emph{(pin/s)} that need to be connected to the source in minimum cost.
	\item Obstacle : A block that wires can't go through.
	\item Vias : A passage to the upper or lower layer.
	\item Wire : What connects the pins with each others \emph{(made of a specific metal)}.
	\item Path : The route, which the wire takes, in order to connect the source with all of the targets.
	\item Cost : The length of the path. The longer the wire, the larger the delay.
	\item Multi-layers : Instead of having only one $2D$ grid, we have multiple grids \emph{(stacked vertically)}.
	\item Steiner points : Intermediate points that targets can be connected to.
\end{itemize}
