\begin{itemize}
	\item Maze: A $[D,W,H]$ matrix that contains cells, used to simulate the grid.
    \item D: Number of layers, W: width of the layer, H: height of the layer.
    \item Cells: Each cell is a pin, a cell could represent a pin or an obstacle.
	\item Pin: The part where transistors gets connected to.
	\item Source: The starting point (pin) that needs to be connected to some targets.
	\item Targets: One or many point/s (pin/s) that need to be connected to the source in minimum cost.
	\item Obstacle: A block that wires can't go through.
	\item Vias: A passage to the upper or lower layer.
	\item Wire: What connects the pins with each others.
	\item Path: The route which the wire will take in order to connect the source with all of the targets.
	\item Cost: The length of the path, the longer the wire the larger the delay.
	\item Multi-layers: Instead of having only one $2D$ grid, we have multiple grids, stacked vertically.
	\item Steiner points: Intermediate points that targets can be connected to.
