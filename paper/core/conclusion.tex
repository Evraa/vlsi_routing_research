In this work, we discuss the \emph{detailed routing} problem, and how it's an important challenge in manufacturing process, showing that it can be formulated as grid search problem.
\emph{A* Search} algorithm, with euclidean distance as cost function, is our main approach in the problem solution.
We have tried different grid search techniques and compared their results with our main approach with respect to performance and time, and found that
\emph{A* Search} achieves better performance in some cases and same performance in others, maintaining an acceptable time, compared to optimal algorithms, but relatively longer time than approximate algorithms.
