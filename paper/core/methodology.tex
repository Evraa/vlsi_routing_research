\subsection{Motivation}
Metal routing is a critical step in systems integration process, where each source is connected to its fan-outs using non-crossing metal. Routing in a modern chip, with millions or even billions of transistors, can be very complicated and cumbersome, so the manufacture process has moved to automatic routing. 

Automatic routing is a very vast field, with several techniques being developed through time. Automatic routing involves lots of problems like finding shortest non-blocked path and VIAs in multi-layer routing. 

Automatic routing techniques are always a trade-off between optimality and speed. Some techniques target execution time by reaching a sub-optimal solution. Others target optimal solution with very high execution time.

In this work, we seek a good balance between performance and optimality of solution by introducing the usage of A* search for automatic routing with a modified cost function.
